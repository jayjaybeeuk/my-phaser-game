# Maniacal Miner - AI Assistant Context

## Project Overview
A modern recreation of the classic Manic Miner platformer game, built with Phaser.js and TypeScript. This is a retro-style platformer with air depletion mechanics, collectibles, moving enemies, and multiple levels.

## Tech Stack
- **Game Engine**: Phaser.js v3.88.2
- **Language**: TypeScript (ES6, strict mode)
- **Build Tool**: Webpack 5
- **Desktop**: Electron v28
- **Node Version**: 24.11.1 (see `.nvmrc`)

## Key Features
- Classic Manic Miner gameplay mechanics
- Three unique levels: Central Cavern, Underground Chamber, Arctic Zone
- Air depletion system
- Collectible items and scoring
- Moving enemies with AI
- Lives and high score system
- Smooth sprite animations
- Audio integration (web only - disabled in Electron due to file protocol limitations)
- Debug menu for development
- Gamepad/controller support with automatic detection
- Cross-platform: Web (Vercel) and Desktop (Electron)

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev              # Start webpack dev server (http://localhost:8080)
npm run build            # Production build for web
npm run electron         # Run Electron app
npm run electron:dev     # Run Electron in development mode
npm run electron:build:mac    # Build Mac desktop app
npm run electron:build:win    # Build Windows desktop app
npm run electron:build:linux  # Build Linux desktop app
```

## Code Style & Conventions
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, ES6 target
- **Naming**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables/functions
- **Architecture**: Scene-based architecture with managers for assets and levels
- **File Organization**: Group by feature/type (scenes, objects, systems)

## Important Notes
1. **Audio Limitation**: Audio is disabled in Electron builds due to file protocol issues. Web version has full audio support.
2. **Asset Loading**: Assets are loaded through AssetManager for centralized management
3. **Level System**: Levels are managed by LevelManager with JSON data files
4. **Controls**: Support for keyboard (Arrow keys/WASD) and gamepad input
5. **Debug Features**: Debug menu available in development builds (level skip, collision debug, unlimited lives)

## Common Tasks
- **Adding a new level**: Update LevelManager and create level data JSON
- **Adding sprites**: Place in `assets/` and register in AssetManager
- **Modifying game mechanics**: Check GameScene.ts and relevant systems
- **Fixing TypeScript errors**: Check type definitions, especially for Phaser plugins
- **Building for desktop**: Ensure assets are properly bundled in webpack config

## Known Issues
- Gamepad plugin requires proper initialization (use `this.input.gamepad.once('connected', ...)` pattern)
- Audio doesn't work in Electron builds (file:// protocol limitation)
- TypeScript strict mode may require explicit typing for Phaser objects

## Testing
- Manual testing via dev server for web version
- Test Electron builds separately as they have different constraints
- Verify gamepad support with physical controller
- Check all three levels for progression and mechanics

## Deployment
- **Web**: Deployed on Vercel (see `vercel.json`)
- **Desktop**: Built with electron-builder to `release/` directory

## When Helping
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Follow existing architecture patterns (scenes, managers, systems)
- Consider both web and Electron compatibility
- Test changes in dev server before suggesting production builds
- Preserve retro game feel while using modern code practices
- Reference Phaser 3 documentation for API usage
